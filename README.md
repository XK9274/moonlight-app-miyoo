## Custom keybinds/cpuclock value

To set up your custom keybinds, you'll currently need to open the file `/mnt/SDCARD/App/moonlight/config/settings.json`

The file will contain:

```json
{
    "customkeys": {
        "A": "SPACE",
        "B": "BACKSPACE",
        "X": "X",
        "Y": "Y",
        "L1": "E",
        "L2": "Q",
        "R1": "T",
        "R2": "P",
        "LeftDpad": "LEFT",
        "RightDpad": "RIGHT",
        "UpDpad": "UP",
        "DownDpad": "DOWN",
        "Start": "RETURN",
        "Select": "M",
        "Menu": "ESCAPE"
    },
    "cpuclock": "1900",
    "mouse": {
        "scaleFactor": 2,
        "acceleration": 2.0,
        "accelerationRate": 2.5,
        "maxAcceleration": 10.0
    }
}
```
- Keybind values will have to be set based on their SDLK value, you can find the full list here: [SDLK Common names](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/sdlkey.html)
   - For example; SDLK_BACKSPACE will become BACKSPACE, SDLK_RCTRL will become RCTRL.
- CPUclock is ranged between 1000 -> 1950, defaulting at 1700. 

## To Do

- Add settings menu
- Go back to menu after quitting a game/stream
- Add options menu hotkey while streaming
- Gamepad etc
- FIX APP STARTUP/QUITTING

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### When i launch a game it doesn't start on the remote desktop
- I think i know why, just haven't had time to look into why the GS (gs_quit_app) function is failing.

### When i launch the app it says "loading" and then closes instantly
- If you used filezilla to transfer the files to the card, delete them and use Samba/HTTP instead. IF this doesn't resolve it, check the line endings on the script files are UNIX. not Windows.
- If this doesn't resolve it. Contact me

### When i press start on a menu option the app closes
- Close the keyboard with the X button on the MMP, then select the menu item with the A button
  
### Is there a build script for Moonlight?
- Not yet, but soon.

### It's laggy. What can I do?
- Don't stream at 4k/2k resolutions. Remove any higher resolutions from Sunshine under the General tab.

### The display is letterboxed on the MMP display when using Sunshine. How do I fix this?
- Set your desktop resolution to a 4:3 aspect ratio, such as 1400x1050 or 1280x960. If you're launching directly into a game, set the game's aspect ratio to 4:3 as well.

### Moonlight crashes after quitting a running stream and then reconnecting with Sunshine.
- The stream takes time to fully terminate. Give it a few seconds before trying to reconnect.

### The app has stopped or is not working. What should I do?
- Use the menu option to "Unpair" and then restart the app.

### There are audio pops when opening the app. Is this normal?
- Yes, this is a known issue with the MMP in general, it's totally "normal" with how the HW is configured.

### Input continues to be passed to the host even after exiting Moonlight. Why is this?
- This is a known issue, and i'm looking into it.
